# PocaFamily

The Poca family of open-source synthesizers are a joint effort between Animal Factory Amplification and Synthfarm run by Varun Desai. The Poca family helps to introduce soldering techniques and the joy of synthesis using a simple set of modules.

## PocaSynth

Based off the Forest Mimm's Stepped Tone Generator circuit, this bastardized Atari Punk console project is the perfect little beginner's synth for any enthusiast to build.


## PocaSeek

Building off the success of the PocaSynth, the PocaSeq is its new best friend. It's a simple 5 step sequencer, built off the CD4017 decade counter and 555 timer chip the Seq adds sequencing functionality to any willing module.


## PocaFilter

Inspired from the MFOS Noise Toaster and designed but Electroidiot, the PocaFilter brings much needed low-pass filtration to tame the gnarly square waves of the PocaSynth.


## PocaLFO

The only digital entry to the Poca lineup, the PocaLFO introduces 4 digital waveforms to modulate CV destinations of its Poca counterparts. Based on an Arduino Nano, the PocaLFO aims to educate students on how to write code for microcontrollers.
